        **üçÑ Mushroom Classification** is a vital task that involves distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms.  
        This project leverages **machine learning** ü§ñ techniques to automatically classify mushrooms based on their features.  
        Accurate classification of mushrooms is essential to ensure the **safety** üõ°Ô∏è of people, as many mushrooms can be **toxic** ‚ò†Ô∏è or **deadly** üíÄ if consumed.

        ### üèÜ Our system offers two models:
        - **üõ†Ô∏è Model 1**: A **user-friendly tool** where users input characteristics of mushrooms to identify whether they are **edible** üçΩÔ∏è or **poisonous** ‚ò†Ô∏è.  
        - **üìä Model 2**: A **dataset-based classifier** where users can **upload a mushroom dataset** to predict the classification of various mushrooms.

        This model is perfect for users who encounter mushrooms in the wild and wish to determine if it is safe to eat. The simplicity of input ensures quick and accurate results.

        1. Choose the mushroom's physical characteristics from the dropdown menus (e.g., cap shape, cap color, gill spacing).
