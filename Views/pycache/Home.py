        Welcome to the **Mushroom Classification Project**! This advanced system uses machine learning models to help classify mushrooms as either **edible** or **poisonous** based on their physical features.
        
        The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use platform for mushroom enthusiasts, researchers, and foragers to identify mushrooms quickly and safely.

        In this project, we have developed two models:
        - **Model 1**: üçÑ  Input the characteristics of a mushroom to predict if it's edible or poisonous.
        - **Model 2**:  üìä Upload a mushroom dataset and classify multiple mushrooms automatically.

    st.write(
        """
        Our project uses a **pattern-matching classification model** to identify mushroom edibility based on specific mushroom features.  
        The system takes user input for mushroom characteristics, encodes them into shorthand codes, and applies a structured pattern-matching algorithm to classify mushrooms.

        ---

        ## üçÑ **1. Feature-Based Classification**  
        The model takes the following mushroom attributes as input:  

        - **Odor** ‚Äì Scent of the mushroom (e.g., Almond, Fishy, Foul).  
            ‚û°Ô∏è Odor is one of the strongest indicators of mushroom edibility. Certain toxic mushrooms have distinct foul or pungent odors.  
        - **Bruises** ‚Äì Whether the mushroom bruises easily (Yes/No).  
            ‚û°Ô∏è Bruising behavior often correlates with the presence of toxic compounds.  
        - **Gill Color** ‚Äì The color of the gills under the mushroom cap (e.g., White, Brown, Yellow).  
            ‚û°Ô∏è Some poisonous mushrooms have specific gill color patterns.  
        - **Cap Shape** ‚Äì Shape of the mushroom cap (e.g., Bell, Flat, Convex).  
            ‚û°Ô∏è Shape is used to identify the mushroom species and predict toxicity.  
        - **Cap Surface** ‚Äì Surface texture of the mushroom cap (e.g., Smooth, Scaly).  
            ‚û°Ô∏è Toxic mushrooms often have irregular or rough cap surfaces.  
        - **Cap Color** ‚Äì Color of the mushroom cap (e.g., Red, White, Yellow).  
            ‚û°Ô∏è Some bright or unusual colors can indicate toxicity.  

        ---

        ## üìä **2. Prediction Workflow**  
        **Step-by-Step Process:**  
        1. User selects mushroom features through the interface.  
        2. Features are encoded into shorthand codes.  
        3. Encoded values are evaluated using a ML algorithm.  
        4. If the pattern matches a known toxic or edible combination, the result is shown instantly.  
        5. If uncertain, the model defaults to **poisonous** for safety.  

        ---

        ## üöÄ **3. Key Features:**  
        ‚úÖ **Fast and accurate predictions** using pattern matching.  
        ‚úÖ **User-friendly interface** for quick input and feedback.  
        ‚úÖ **Structured encoding** of mushroom attributes for accuracy.  
        ‚úÖ **Immediate classification** ‚Äî results in real-time.  
        ‚úÖ **Handles ambiguous patterns** by prioritizing safety.  
        ‚úÖ **Scalable** ‚Äî capable of handling multiple inputs and datasets.  
        ‚úÖ **High reliability** ‚Äî model trained on real-world data patterns.  

        ---

        ## ‚ö†Ô∏è **4. Important Safety Notice:**  
        - Even though the model is highly accurate, **do not rely solely on AI predictions** for mushroom consumption.  
        - Always consult an expert or reference trusted sources before consuming any wild mushrooms.  
        - Toxic mushrooms can have subtle variations ‚Äî visual confirmation is not always sufficient.  
        - When in doubt, **do not consume**!
